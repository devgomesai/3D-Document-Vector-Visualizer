[00:00] Hey everyone, welcome to another video. [00:02] So if you guys are wondering how does [00:04] the interview experience at Nutanix or [00:06] some other uh companies that pay really [00:08] where looks like this video is going to [00:11] be for you. If you are in college or if [00:13] you're already working at some company [00:15] and want to make a switch then I would [00:17] suggest that watch till end. Uh with [00:20] that I'll get started. So if anyone is [00:22] new to the channel I'll just give a [00:24] little bit overview about myself. [00:28] So who am I? Uh so I currently work at [00:31] Microsoft and I have close to four years [00:33] of experience now and I have 2,000 plus [00:36] lead code on test rating and last year I [00:39] got 10 job offer fortunate enough. [00:41] During that time I gave more than 100 [00:44] interview rounds and also I have solved [00:45] more than 3,000 coding problems across [00:48] all the platforms. Now as I have watched [00:50] my videos and also I've got some [00:52] feedback. So if you want a better [00:54] experience, I would suggest watch at [00:56] 1.5x and also we do live stream every [00:59] day where I solve coding problems. So [01:02] feel free to um join that as well. Uh [01:06] with that said, so let's this video is [01:09] going to we are going to talk about [01:10] nutanics specifically and um just to [01:13] tell you guys so I had couple I have [01:16] given so many interviews. So I was I got [01:18] some offers some rejections. So these [01:20] are the companies where I got rejected [01:22] at. These are the companies where I got [01:24] um offered at right and is one of them. [01:28] So uh I apped for MTS3 which is [01:31] equivalent to SD3 also. It's like the [01:33] third level MTS head and in this we are [01:35] going to talk about the interview [01:37] experience. Also I'll be sharing prep [01:39] steps at each of the step that I'm [01:41] talking about. Right. Okay. With that uh [01:44] let's jump to the first thing. Right. So [01:45] this is clueless me. I have no idea what [01:48] is going on. I just wanted to make [01:49] switch but then you get lost with what [01:52] to do right whether to do HL whether to [01:54] do LL how much DSA all sort of things [01:56] right so let's talk about one thing at a [02:00] time right so rum and application so I [02:03] have onepage rum uh onepage [02:06] rum I follow Jake template uh there is a [02:09] rum video on the channel Jake template [02:13] keep it neat and clean I think you don't [02:15] need more than one page and then [02:17] application directly play on the career [02:19] portal. [02:21] I did not get any referral. No referral, [02:24] right? And then I would have applied to [02:26] like 10 to 15 com 10 to 15 openings and [02:30] then automatically got a got a call from [02:32] recruiter. [02:35] Uh pretty straightforward. So recently I [02:37] made a video that how you guys should [02:39] apply right how what strategy that you [02:41] guys should follow. So feel free to [02:43] check that video out right. So I'll [02:45] attach the links of those videos also in [02:47] the description. So after that it was [02:49] not instant. I think after 10 to 15 days [02:52] or even 20 days I got a um message that [02:55] um but not even a message I directly got [02:58] a mail that okay this is the online [03:00] assessment and uh you have to do so it [03:02] it comprises of coding questions right [03:04] and how was the [03:07] how was the uh the online assessment? So [03:10] it comprised of two two lead code [03:14] type ESA questions [03:17] right and uh if I have to level them [03:19] both were from I would say um this these [03:22] were not easy so medium level but not [03:25] hard also right so and I was able to [03:28] solve both of them in 30 minutes and uh [03:31] so with that I knew that okay I'll be [03:33] getting a call I'll be getting a call [03:35] back and uh uh so just to guide more [03:40] here right how you should prepare. So [03:42] lead code contest is the best way to [03:44] prepare for online assessment. I would [03:46] say at least target [03:49] A, [03:51] B and C problems on lead code contest, [03:54] right? And also if if I have to give you [03:57] some rating that because I was always [03:59] wondering so if your rating is around [04:01] 1,800, right? Or let's say 1715 [04:06] 1715 to 1800 then that means that you [04:08] are pretty good, right? So you are not [04:11] at a like a rubric level like you are [04:13] not a great competitive programmer if [04:15] you have this much rating but you are [04:18] good enough to clear interviews of the [04:20] companies right so uh that is what I [04:22] would suggest everyone lead code contest [04:24] give virtual and give practical right uh [04:27] so that that the pretty straightforward [04:30] right two lead code style questions if [04:31] you are wondering then you should highly [04:33] practice need code 150 right and then [04:36] coming to the round right so after this [04:38] I got a call back that Okay, we are in [04:41] this till this time [04:45] um I did not have much conversation with [04:47] the recruiter. So directly online [04:48] assessment came and then uh DSA round [04:51] came. Right now [04:54] there is one more thing that I would [04:55] like to highlight here is sometimes [04:57] recruiters are busy. So after one week [05:00] or so you should definitely give them a [05:02] call back. Right? I think I did that in [05:04] this after applying I got a call and [05:06] then again I did not get any call. So [05:09] after a week I followed up with them. So [05:10] that's where I got a online assessment [05:12] rate. So it is always helpful to follow [05:14] up with the recruiter. Now going to the [05:17] DSA round right this was like u 60 [05:20] minutes I think standard 60 minutes [05:23] round. 60 minutes taken by MTS2 right [05:27] and then uh so two DSA questions [05:31] both were I would say medium level [05:33] medium to little bit hard right? Medium [05:35] to hard but not hard right. um higher [05:39] side of BTM not the easier side but a [05:41] harder side. So I had never seen both of [05:44] these problems but again one lead code [05:46] style only just like think of it we are [05:49] giving a lead code contest and two new [05:51] problems probably B and C right it's [05:54] like B and C exactly like B and C of [05:56] lead code contests [05:58] so and uh I like this was one of the [06:02] round where I was kind of stuck at one [06:04] of the HKS and I thought that okay it [06:07] came over there were like three two step [06:08] four minutes left but then I kind of [06:11] controlled my nerves and I was be able [06:12] to write this code also like that that [06:14] kind of things is where lead code [06:17] context really helps you in building [06:18] that so that you can handle your nerves [06:20] properly right and u I was able to solve [06:23] both of things so feedback was positive [06:25] if I have to rate myself I would rate [06:26] myself 9 out of 10 uh in this I would [06:29] rate myself 10 out of 10 right pretty [06:32] straightforward now coming to the [06:34] low-level design right so as this is for [06:36] MTS3 there was design also so uh in the [06:41] low-level design um I was this was taken [06:44] by a senior MTS [06:47] senior MTS probably I think someone with [06:49] close to 10 years of experience and I [06:52] was given a low-level question right so [06:55] following uh oops principle design [06:57] patterns [06:59] design patterns not much little bit on [07:01] the design patterns and uh I have to [07:03] design like classes also very [07:06] straightforward it was again for 60 [07:08] minutes so like code was expected But uh [07:11] it is okay if the code was not working [07:13] also but design like classes and code [07:16] was expected classes [07:19] and code was expected like I have not [07:22] seen this problem this problem is uh [07:24] low-level design problem was pretty like [07:27] little bit unique to me but if you have [07:29] solved some of the problem so there are [07:32] like um I have I have all the links here [07:35] let me go to the links as well so these [07:37] are the low-level design resources that [07:39] I personally recommend [07:41] Right? If you want to go with a free re [07:43] resource, this is Ashish Praab's repo [07:45] that you can go to and it has all the [07:48] questions here. Right? Um this is pretty [07:50] good. But in here you will only find the [07:53] code, right? But let's say if you want [07:55] to kind of um like see how the [07:58] processes, how to design the class [08:00] diagram, then I would suggest you go [08:02] with educative, right? And you can buy [08:04] their like standard one month plan. And [08:06] I do have a link where you can get a 10% [08:10] discount if you use that. Uh feel free [08:12] to use that. I'll attach that in the [08:14] link as well. But I'll come to all the [08:16] resources uh when I discuss about HLD [08:19] because that's more important there. But [08:22] uh yeah, so for you have to do hands-on [08:25] coding and I use Java here and uh even [08:29] though I don't use Java at work, I use [08:31] Java for this one, right? And it was [08:33] pretty good. But I would say if I have [08:35] to rate myself, it was kind of 8 out of [08:37] 10 or 8.5 out of 10. Uh classes are [08:41] important. Oops principle are important. [08:43] And then the code was expected. It is [08:45] not just a class diagram. You have to [08:46] write the code. And then coming to [08:49] highle design. This was pretty [08:51] interesting. I think this was taken by [08:54] again a senior MTS. [08:59] Senior MTS. And then I was given HLD [09:02] problem just the problem statement like [09:05] one line [09:08] problem statement. Now if you have gone [09:11] through the educative object even I have [09:14] gone through their courses I have gone [09:16] through all the problems distributed [09:18] cache distributed um e value store [09:21] distributed and then uh your YouTube [09:24] Instagram design all of these right uh [09:27] design YouTube etc like this was not the [09:30] question that was asked to me but it was [09:32] very similar to like design xyz right [09:37] I won't be able to reveal the exact [09:38] questions But yeah, this if you have [09:40] done if you have gone through uh [09:45] system design [09:48] book by Alexu then then you'll be like [09:52] pretty much able to answer this question [09:54] right but in day-to-day life also you [09:57] would have seen similar problem it was [09:58] nothing out of the box but yeah I had [10:01] never solved that question but using the [10:03] framework I was able to solve right now [10:05] if I talk about courses right I'll [10:07] little bit touch on how I practice my [10:10] high level design. So these are the [10:12] resources that I used. I'll attach the [10:14] link also this system design system [10:16] design code are free. But the thing with [10:19] these resources are these are not that [10:21] much exhaustive. These does not cover [10:23] all the questions. So that is where this [10:25] is one of the course that I have [10:27] personally gone through right. So [10:29] rocking system design interview. Now if [10:30] you go to the content of it right and [10:33] for I'll just collapse also these are [10:36] kind of the questions that you will get. [10:37] you'll get something around this like [10:39] distributed cache is very popular rate [10:42] limiter is very popular right and [10:44] distributed logging distributed task [10:46] scheduleuler YouTube Google maps and [10:49] Uber right these are all very famous [10:51] question and they do have a really good [10:53] breakdown so I would suggest everyone to [10:55] kind of if you can if you want to go [10:58] with something 500 rupees per month [11:00] which is kind of affordable right so you [11:02] can go with this and also apart from [11:04] educative right if you want to go with [11:06] free and you can go with free and also [11:09] hello interview is also good and again [11:11] I'll highlight this also so this is also [11:14] really good and again it is paid or not [11:17] all the problems are um [11:20] uh unlocked so it is also paid and uh [11:23] but for educative uh I do have a link [11:26] where you can kind of get 10% discount [11:28] so I'll attach that in description so if [11:31] you buy via that link you will get 10% [11:34] discount on top of this uh feel free to [11:36] utilize that. Feel free to let me know [11:38] if you have more questions in the chat. [11:39] But I really suggest that those are like [11:42] really good courses. So educative [11:46] specifically system design course right [11:51] and uh for free courses I think code is [11:54] pretty good and then uh Ashishab GitHub [11:58] repo by Karanab all of these are good [12:02] right but if you like want more chances [12:05] that you would have already seen that [12:07] problem so that's where I would [12:08] recommend educative [12:10] uh so that was my HLD interview Uh [12:13] moving to hiring manager again hiring [12:15] manager once I got a call that okay you [12:17] have passed this. So uh again project [12:20] specific questions [12:23] right what projects I did right and then [12:25] behavioral questions how I handle [12:27] conflicts like handling conflicts uh [12:30] tight guidelines right and then working [12:33] with others right uh [12:37] working with others right working with [12:39] your teammates these are of things [12:41] mentoring people [12:44] like if you're appearing for MT SD2 MTS3 [12:47] SD3 right you need to have some [12:49] mentoring experience. I forgot to give [12:51] this rating. I would rate myself very [12:53] high in this one because I was able to [12:55] design the whole system end to end and [12:57] just from a problem statement, right? So [12:59] eventually I got an offer right um of [13:02] the the total CTC was more than 60 right [13:06] and if I have to talk about the base [13:08] base was around 35. So that was the [13:11] overall experience of Nutanix. uh in the [13:14] end if I have to conclude it by saying [13:15] right I have faced more than 900 rection [13:18] it's not like that I have only got [13:20] offers that is not the truth but you [13:22] have to be consistent you have to be [13:23] resilient with your preparation and then [13:26] uh coming to uh what preparator [13:29] resources right all the links are here [13:32] right all the links are mentioned here [13:34] if you want a dedic dedicated approach [13:36] in learning then educative is something [13:38] I would suggest hello interviews I would [13:41] something I suggest they do have a [13:42] premium premium membership I myself have [13:44] bought premium membership of these two [13:46] both right so but for hello interview I [13:49] don't have any kind of discount which I [13:51] can offer so that's why [13:53] uh groing is more exhaustive so I would [13:56] suggest you go with that and uh other [13:58] than that for DSA also I have given [14:01] these resources so this is the best way [14:03] of solving so you go to this and then [14:05] you sort the problems by rating and [14:07] that's how you solve it right so you no [14:10] need to spend like 10 to 20k learning [14:12] DSA That would is my p personal choice [14:15] and personal preference right no need to [14:16] spend that much money. So with that I'll [14:19] end the video here. Uh thank you so [14:21] much. I hope you guys all liked it. Feel [14:23] free to let me know in chat if you have [14:26] any feedback. Uh that's all. Thank you. [14:28] Bye-bye. Take care.
