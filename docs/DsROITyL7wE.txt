Traffic rules violation Traffic rules key books Malikawa not violation traffic rules he books Malikawagi Abapna right handy Will rooftop K Upper Nigalkalkar Sa Sharakar Sakta you can or Kai Sharakara either Kanigar right Nijana Kiddar Jana and the answer is yes. Moving on further, that is CSR committee composition. Well, in the Schedule 7 CSR committee composition 135 subsection 1 may at least three directors one of whom shall be independent director. In those companies where the ID is compulsory Independent director appoint karna compulsory at least one of them shall be ID or satmay. Exception Exception that one exception of this general rule is company is not required to appoint independent director. Those case may any two or more directors will be sufficient to make the CSR committee. So CSR committee may well General Rule section 135 subsection 1 section 135 subsection 1 deals with the CSR committee or compulsory appointment. Well, I'll come back to this. Independent director appoint mandatory. Well, independent director is compulsory. It is mandatory in these companies which are covered in 149 subsection 4 point mandatory companies listed public company at least one third of total number of directors shall be independent director and 1/3 calculate fraction rounding off to 1 will be there Total number of directors Total number of directors 10 and 1/3 of 10 is 1/3 of 10 is 3.33. So that 3.33 is 3 or 44 3.33 is 4 total 10 directors listed public company minimum char independent director minimum requirement is there and then we say unlisted public company or other unlisted public company paid up capital is 10 crore or more or turnover is 500. This 100 crore or more or aggregate borrowing is more than 50 crore. Borrowings may equal to sign greater than so paid up capital exact 10 crore or more turnover exact hundred crore or more and borrowings are more than 50 crore or unlisted public company shall appoint at least two independent directors plus section 149K Alava Kisi or section May Koi higher number for example audit committee May section 177 May audit committee higher number of independent directors higher number of point requirement the listed public companies may 1/3 at least 1/3 or unlisted public companies following the criteria minimum 2 independent directors are compulsory over there listed public Companies at least 1/3 of total number of director independent director unlisted public companies paid up capital 10 crore or more or turnover 100 crore or more or borrowings more than 50 crores then minimum minimum two independent directors shall be appointed independent director appointment CSR committee may at least three directors, one of whom shall be independent director. This is for those companies in which section 149 subsection 4 is applicable and appointment of the independent Director is mandatory. 1494 may fall Independent director appointment now in that case any two or more directors are sufficient to make the CSR committee Net worth security premium account free reserves paid up capital paid up capital or 496 crore security premium account the net worth turnover Hamari Hani turnover Hamari sock road be touch or will boring whatever net profit 1494 may fall nahi Karthik Net profit panch crude net profit panch crowd CSR committee Banani Paragi Hamari paid up capital dusk road say come here profit net profit turnover be sock road say come here problem net profit valley criteria or CSR committee any two directors or ID Oniki net worth turnover net profit turnover be sauce or borrowings net profit only two directors getting that well that is CSR committee is not required CSR committee is not required at all.

The activity undertaken by the company outside India except for training of Indian sports personnel will representing any state or union territory at national level or India at international level. In general. In general. In general. Training outside India. Training outside India of the Indian sports personnel representing any Indian state Representing any Indian union territory at the national level. At the or the India level or the international level. If you see badminton player. Thank you very much. So well I'll say the PV Sindhu and the other people who are famous for badminton. Tata consultancy services. Your Tata Steel version International training camp. Somewhere in Sweden, somewhere in Spain, somewhere in Europe. Or spending five star hotel or Puri team. She is not the only one. Badminton team or training schedule in those international conditions. Something like that. Or Tata Memorial. And the answer is yes. Olympics badminton event sponsorship. So point number two, is it eligible for CSR or not? Yes or no Question. Agar Tata Motors limited Agar Tata Motors limited Is spending rupees two crore on what? Two crore on training of Indian cricket team in England or for sponsorship of World cup tournament over there. Well outside India. So first case answer is yes. And second case answer is no training. Yes training. Answer is no clear spending. And the answer is yes. Indian company India Bahar B CSR spending Indian sports person international training India that is there. Then point number three. Contribution of any amount directly indirectly to any political party. Political Chanda Derenji political Sevagh section 182 Alexei or section 182 in the chapter of board of directors. Infinite contribution, unlimited contribution bank account Khalikato company insolvent Managing director. Check Cardia Aglay election Kili or Hamari Kamika bank account. The company becomes Insolvent or next AGMB managing director. But I'll say Section 182 managing director political contribution. Check the Chota Yota amount. That is how it is. Political contribution. Though CSR may count that will not be counted in csr. Next one Activities benefiting the employees of the company. Employees benefit Nahi Kara Hamari company like in Baharwala Koini Kushnikara Hamari Kamnigajo employees Unkebache school Me Patreon free education mildriyato e CSR nahiha employees. That's it. Reliance obviously escorts employees. 70,000 per month. 80,000 per month. Then point number five. Activities supported by the company on the sponsorship basis for deriving the marketing benefits of for its products or services. Marketing expense. That is not CSR over there. Then marketing benefit services Achahamapna product Government school products Limited products Government School Medekar Inspire Karna Hamari Kamika Baki Products Karido Limited Products School Majority Products Exhibition Exhibition Limited 10% Stock 90% Exhibition Marketing Benefit Next one activities carried out for fulfillment of any other statutory obligation under any law. Statutory obligation Water Pollution act may Air Pollution act may Environment Protection act obligation Forest cover Lagana Hai or Apo Karayo as per the specific act Environmental license Milatha Lagani Panches obligation Kivjasikarna I hope getting that point number 1, 2, 3, 4, 56 CSR what is CSR what is not CSR other question what is CSR activities but the following 6 are not CSR what is not CSR these 6 points are not CSR Indian Sports person training CSR Manlia Jayaga well that is the only thing over here CSR Committee International organization well Bolajara means the organization notified by CG as international organization in section 3 of well United nations privilege and the Amenities Act 1947 to which the provisions of schedule are applicable scheduled to the act are applicable International organization Clause H Clause h the net profit 2% of net profit 2% of average net profit. The average net profit section refer Karna section 198 or section 135 Millika. You have to check the net profit as per section 198. Net profit Net profit means the net profit of the company as per the financial statement Financial statement the profit and loss account Financial statement the profit loss account and that is under section 198 prepared as per the provisions of the act or the act section 198 financial statement as per the section 198 or do cheese comply karoge schedule 3b to comply karoge schedule 3b comply karogi plus 198b comply karogi don't comply net profit or exam average net profit calculate Karoge so point number one. Net profit profits arising from overseas branch of Indian company branch India or Indian company profit India may generate main profit to India may generate profit foreign branches India whether operated as a separate company or otherwise profit generator Indian profit may add Nahi Karogi Indian company Indian company and that is Now I am talking about the definition of net profit Indian company Indian branches, overseas branches or Joe profit generate from the Indian branches. Consider profits generate overseas branches. Consider simple surf Indian profit consider 2% of average net profit count Indian profit foreign profit is important Dusra point or B zada important here h2 the answer profit net profit may add Nahi Karangay Hamari Indian company dividend income ATI Hamari Indian company dividend income invest Kia shares invest shares from the other companies in India other companies they are covered in section 135 or other companies have 135 may already upna corporate social responsibility Profit may add Nahi Karangi Profit pay already CSR spending already Agarvo other company section 135 May covered Nahihotito or Mahasi profit may add Karthiya 2% of average net profit may be I hope getting that other companies in India which are covered and which are complying covered and complying section 135 covered covered or 135 comply covered or contravene covered or comply actual CSR spending so then I'll say Pharoh's case may counting May count well PQR Limited which is covered under section 135 plus complies section 135 covered or comply or we have one more company over here ABC just a sec Indian company 135 May covered B or 135 comply DEF Limited Indian company 135 May covered 135 May covered or Hamari company our company is ABC Limited and we are covered in 135 how 135 make our we are covered in 135 dividend income first PQR or second DEFCBRA and then we are saying PQR to dividend area after CSS expenditure profit may count profits may count so if net profit of the ABC in in net profit of ABC the dividend income received from DEF will be considered but the dividend received from the PQR will not be considered or examined net profit I hope getting that simple nothing much complicated Then talking about this further I'll say the next point that we are having proviso last point in the net profit thing Foreign company Indian company Foreign company means a company incorporated outside India and it is having a branch or office in India either of itself or through agent either physically or electronically and carries on the business activity in India Foreign company Remember that so in case of the foreign company covered under these rules well net profit means which net profit Net net profit means a net profit as per the profit loss account prepared as per section 3381 subsection 1 clause a red red with 198 or iskamatlav only Indian profit only Indian profit foreign company foreign company is having let us say 100 branches in different different countries company saw branches India joint profit Indian profit Foreign branches or 98 branches outside India Indian branches spending Karni Badegi or India may CSR spending India 5 crore or more. Now they are stuck up with 135 in India. I am coming to that Foreign company Indian branches profit generated in Indian business will be considered or profit India Coca Cola Coca Cola American company Obviously like in Coca Cola Indian subsidiary India Coca Cola America subsidiary company Indian subsidiary company Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages limited Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages limited In Bengaluru registered office in Bengaluru it's an Indian company as per Indian Companies Act 2013 Certificate of incorporation India may issue as per Indian Companies Act. Subsidiary India may have Microsoft Microsoft subsidiary India may have Facebook subsidiary India may have Google key subsidiary India Google India branch Mauritius may or Mauritius may be business career Mauritius for a profit Indian profit may add like in Google India simple. So net profit definition just a sec. Then moving on into this will I'll say ongoing project. What is ongoing project again current year it is maximum three financial years excluding the current financial year in which the project is started. So it is current financial year plus maximum 3 financial years. Current financial year plus maximum 3 subsequent financial years ongoing project or Sathma Kara. It shall also include any such project that was initially not initially not approved for as multi year. Initially like in that case initially it was not approved as multi year but whose duration has been extended beyond one year or by by the board of directors based on the reasonable justification ongoing project. I hope getting this simple board reporting maximum 2%. You can spend every year in the same project up same project 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 8%. You can do that. Public authority means as defined in the Right of Information act. And this section means obviously sections of companies act irrelevant. Nothing much relevant about that in India. So every company including holding company subsea company foreign company defined in section 2 clause 42 having the branch office or project office in India the foreign company India branch office project office they shall comply. Sari companies who comply Karna Holding Companies 135 May Fall Holding Company 135 May Fall Korea subsequent individual profit individually criteria may fall CSR and then we are saying net net worth turnover net profit of the foreign company shall be computed as per 381 subsection 1 clause A that is for for Indian business foreign business count Nahi Karangay Silver Surf Indian business Indian business now rule 3 sub rule 2 ministry of corporate affairs drafting may problem every company which ceases to be falling in section 135 ceases to be falling in section 135 for how many years?

Now moving into the CSR Further CSR Department CSR Activity Section 8 Public Charitable Trust Society in The Society Registration act the Board of directors of the company Board of directors of the company shall ensure that the board of directors of the company shall ensure that the company that CSR activity is undertaken either by the company itself itself own CSR department own CSR department company or through option 1 own CSR department. Your option 2 here which is a section 8 company this is your option 2. Option 2 hamari kabni jesse example section 8 non profit organization or joby 2% 8 company or section 8 company CSR may khurchkar option 3 hamari company create karla registered public trust Create Karla in the Indian Trust act or Registered Society registered Option 4 registered Society CSR Department Section 8 Company Banalo Yafir registered public trusted society Private trust or public trust Me private trust Private family members Ambani Family Trust Adani Family Trust Tata Family Trust or public trusted public trust Society Trust Exempted for the purpose of section 10 subsection 23C or clause 4566A in the in the Income Tax act or you have your Register under section 12A8YG of Income Tax acted entities will fall and to be very honest section 23 section 1023 c nahi pata section 12 I am not interested in knowing that as well. If you feel like exempted or registered under the Income Tax act section number exempted or registered under the Income Tax act so or inco established Abhish decrees section 8 company public trust registered society established by the company trust KB society or section 8 company established either by the company singly or along with other companies Tata Steel or Tata Motors or Tata Consultancy Services Tino Gala CSR Karna Mandatory Section 8 Companies Single Section 8 Company TCA Startup Motor Starter Steel Tino Milkar US A Single Section 8 Company CSR Project May CSR program may use Oga simple it is even better kiyap135 criteria may fall it's even better. Well milk section 8 company banalo or section 8 company education kilibanalo egg section 8 company sports kili banalo getting that section 8 company education promotion sports permission instead of making one, you can make two section 8 companies that is there then going on further the next thing a company established under section 8 of the act will section 8 company registered trust registered society section 8 company central government state government section 8 company banaya trust banaya Society Banaya Central government State government be a registered trust Banasakti Education Trust or Ajkal Sunteham or well Manji Open distance on walking distance from my home the government School It's a huge swimming pool or auditorium PVR cinema hall swimming pool Banadi or auditorium Banadi or Bhatcheja. Is it possible Registered education trust Registered education society or funding that is there. That is there Practical cheese Bolunga exam not for writing an exam Donation CSR donation they are not happy making this is also the way of doing it like in practically CG Hoya SG they don't want section 8 company they don't want to create peros investigation these kind of things are happening. Then next 1 point C. Any entity established under any act of parliament of or the act of parliament or the act of state legislature. So maybe union Union list or maybe state list or we say Parliament central legislation or state legislator State legislation Special entity Entity shall mean the statutory body a statutory corporation having its own statute constituted by the act of parliament or state legislature Only for Special purpose of Schedule 7 activities Schedule 7 key activities Purpose Purpose Schedule 7 key activities and the last point Point D the last point SE section 8 company yeah ache as a registered public trust yeah Registered society Joe Income tax may registered exemption or outsider section 8 company public trust registered society. Here it is having the established track record of three years under the in undertaking the similar activity track record Will USI activity go carry on. It is having the same track record or CSR funding activity already achievements. Just a fictitious example make section 8 registered education trust section 8 company for education purpose. Those are as section 8 as education trust as whatever section 8 company in the education or education trust offer. Those are Chabis Kebab Sola March those are Chabisco consultancy services Mahindra and Mahindra Your Reliance Industries Ltd. Section 8. You put the money well so that will we do something for the education of CS students CA students, CMS students whatever. Can we plan something like for three years from now answer is yes section 8 by making the section 8 company I have to survive on myself and I am not getting any CSR funding for three years. But after three years once the funding will start coming obviously then the things become more comfortable and convenient after that or could say survive. Are you getting that? Reliance Industries limited Point number one CSR Department Registered public trust Banalo Yafir Registered society Option central government Kikoi section 8 company has central government State government Central government State Government Key Section 8 Registered Society Registered Trust Section Schedule 7 Activities Schedule 7 Activities that is there. That is option 3 Option 4 Joe Section 8 Companies here Register Trust here Register Society Baharval Company activity may same field may already come track record. Now we are having these options and we can add even more. The four methods of contributing in CSR ECO Registered Public trust registered society section 8 company or own CSR department section 8 public trust society banalijay or in NPO non profit organization registered public trust society section 8 company like in a caption government owned point number one section 8 kamniya register trust society yafir government owned or option 3 minimum 3 years experience no or other government key section 8 experience track record that is there or entity any entity for especially for schedule 7 any entity especially for schedule 7 activities by made by CG or made by SG entity especially for schedule 7 activities made by CG or made by Sg entity established under the act of Parliament or state legislature for especially for Schedule 7 activities. That's it. Johani Bookman Own CSR Department Administrative Expenses Department May Batting Salary administrative expenditure, electricity water expenses maximum up to 5% of 2% maximum up to 5% of 2% 2% spending maximum 5% administrative expense 5% of 2% 95% activity 5% administrative expenses or remaining 95% real activity that is what is happening maximum 5% of 2% and minimum 95% of 2% the maximum 5% of 2% own CSR department admin expense admin expense or minimum 95% of 2% actual CSR activity clear the own CSR department and admin expense minimum 95% of 2% goes into the CSR activity that's it. Then going on further I'll say example average net profit 2% of Dask 95% 19 lakh CSRK activities or ISI beast Laka well administrative expenditure of your CSR department examples what that total Dask crude total average net profit 2% or B slakka 95% or 5% so this is that example to understand 3 marks 4 marks questions calculations simple simple. So nothing much complicated about that and screen right side Last May and that is three disclosures are required in the board report or and on the website of the company Board report may be thin disclosure CSR committee composition why three directors one of whom is independent director CSR policy CSR annual report or reporting or website maybe Balance sheet section 134 section 134 board report is attached with the balance sheet Complete final picture this is complete picture over here Just a second.

But still still you can treat you can say that your own employees are part of society that way speaking or special note CSR activity revenue generate CSR activity then it shall not be used business activity or option 1 transfer it to any funding schedule 7 within maximum 6 months of the closure of financial year CSR activity employee injection Lagari Karidli maybe you are spending something like 100 rupees to Sorpe daily income or daily at the end of the year schedule 7 fund within six months getting that hunger eradication yes or no? I see examples but just thinking about it then moving on further with that I'll say the next thing that we are having here. So CSR activity already foreign company which is having the branch in India which is having the branch in India or the project in India 135 comply 135 criteria may fall net worth turnover net profit criteria Indian balance sheet or Indian penal account Indian business Scroll back sorry sorry sorry rule 4 may sub rule 2 rule 4 sub rule 2 rule 4 sub rule two clause A and that says Jobi entity CSR spending Karna mandatory entities Central government and file the form CSR1 electronically on the website of MCA the CSR May Khacha Karna Badmishiru karna subsequent form CSR1 file file Kurdo Taki Alarm Bella Ghanti Abne Central Government Kili Ministry of Corporate Affairs Kiliki A core party agijo CSR kle pasalikaraj mayaga central government kobe ache ache party or AGI a company or agai and CSR one file ki ori effective cup kiyan 1st April 2021 say effective CSR spending 1st April 2021 provided that the provision of this subrule shall not affect the CSR projects programs which were Already approved before 1st April 2021 1st April 2021 say I am hoping or future may upcour CSR spending or as ongoing project palace in each Lara CSR one sign and digitally and submit con Karega we are saying shall be well shall be signed and submitted electronically by the entity and shall be verified digitally by a CA in practice or CS in practice or well the cost accountant in practice or isco E filing language pre certification this is called as pre certification in the language of e filing.

So lots of things are happening there or Maharashtra main problem. Maharashtra is having a very big problem or Vojapani Kahani organization or specific stream fear or Badatala Banadiya or Dakliyagi Pani Pishley root Yat Khalia or Aglasalabanadi or Koshish Kartagi irrigation technique. 8,000 villages have already done it. Answer is yes or Unladakunko inspiration They thank you by Tom Jati Ham to my training like in other CSR spending may companies will it be an inspiration something like that. So company then going on further international organization, rainwater harvesting or whatever you want to call it. Then a company may also collaborate with the other companies for undertaking the projects or the programs or the CSR activity in such manner collaborate report separately CSR committees. Then the board of directors of the company shall satisfy itself that the funds are so disbursed have been utilized for this purpose in the manner as approved by it and the CFO or the person responsible for the financial management shall certify to that effect actually utilize or certify this person responsibility for the financial management of the project certify the certification annual certification actually will point out.

The ongoing project upcoming current year plus three financial years properly implement or Usque Satsat will Agar Kahi modification project Go modify for the purpose of conceival modification. For the purpose of smooth implementation of project that is there then going on further. And one more thing which I heard about that companies handicraft silk or saris. Banarasi silk sarees were always famous. Curtains, yoga mats, natural fiber yoga mats. Not the plastic fiber but the natural fiber yoga mats. Jute yoga mats or Abiski obertum Apna rose Gar kama skill training plus free of cost foreign tourists Banaras Jata Hai Vishnath handicraft purchase sales increase packaging material dollar denomination. Not only earning the rupees also earning in the dollars. Permanent SSC upsch already Banarasi silk sari Banakar becho Yoga mat Banakar becho. So can I say that is also a good initiative. That is also a kind of good initiative or like in funding. CSR funding. CSR funding going from corporates over there or Modi constituency hair corporates. Pachaz Gamu election Khali seat nobody can touch well that seat in the next elections very comfortably. Foreign tourists. Foreign tourists. 10,000 tourists per day Foreign tourism.
